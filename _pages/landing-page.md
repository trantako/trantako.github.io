    some visitors demoed a keyboard connected to a computer via MIDI. Mind blown, spent my youth composing music with a similar setup. Recently, I`ve been playing guitars.'

    excerpt: 'I got tired in commuting by car, made some calculations, and bought an e-bike. One of the best decisions I have made. It is so relaxing to begin and end a working day with a 50-minute biking trip. I have 40 km per day to travel, so it took a while to get used to this pace. The first winter went OK, but working from home due to COVID-19 totally messed my routine. Forest paths is a good replacement.'

**Notice:** During the COVID-19 quarantine there has been more home time than ever. I have managed to complete many tasks that have been long coming. A personal website is one of the things that I have wanted to make and now I have finally started to put it together. There is a lot to do and it is still "under construction" as we used to say in the nineties for incomplete websites. Many of the sections are merely placeholders for content that is coming later.
