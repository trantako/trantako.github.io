I was born in 1978 and lived a happy childhood in the '80s. We had only two TV channels (color TV anyway!), a Commodore C-64 microcomputer, lots of Lego Technic, and also a *Märklin H0 electric scale model railroad*. 

My dad had purchased a large wooden board with 6 pcs of 50 cm feet; this was used as a tabletop for the railroad. I think I had two Märklin H0 extension packs, so it was possible to build a fairly long railroad with multiple sidetracks. With my three sisters, we used ordinary Lego blocks to build a town and Fabuland Lego figures as citizens. 

It looked lively and was nice to play with, but I remember that I always dreamed that one day I'd build a real scenery for the railroad instead of using Lego blocks. This project started about 20 years later in 2005 when I and my wife bought our house and there was finally enough space for a kind of man-cave.

The first couple of years the project progressed slowly. When our first child was born, I moved the railroad project to the garage. It has been there since. There's no heating, so most of the time it is just waiting for the next summer...

This page follows the (extremely slow) progress of the railroad project.

## The products

I don't have the boxes anymore, but I found these images from the Internet and I recall these are the products that I got as Christmas and birthday presents in the '80s:

## Building principles

Of course, I am fully aware that there are plenty of products from Märklin and others that you can buy to build a nice scale model. Also, there are hobby shops that sell all kinds of products for making the scenery. Furthermore, Youtube, web pages, and hobby clubs provide instructions and guidance.

Yet, doing it like that was never my intention. On purpose, I have not purchased ready-to-use products, looked up instructions, nor participated in clubs. Instead, I have used all kinds of scrap material from my storage, things that I've got from friends, and mostly invented my own ways of doing this. This has been the whole idea for me.

When building a scale model, many people aim for 100% realism: the scale, the looks, the ground surface, the trees etc. should all be a perfect down-scaled copy of some real location. 

I did not have any specific location in mind. Instead, I had many ideas: there should be two mountains, two tunnels, a bridge, a lake, and a village with a railway station. That's quite a lot for a scale model of this size! As a consequence, I'd have to make compromises. For example, a real train track would not have as steep inclines and declines I'd need to use.

Furthermore, instead of using a particular real-world location, I chose to use my imagination. I just decided to make some kind of Wild West -themed scene: a small town somewhere in Arizona, US. I even considered whether to use the famous comic book hero Lucky Luke, but gave up on that idea.

## Baseboard

I needed some kind of a large baseboard for the whole project. For building that, I used pieces of an old wardrobe. There are just three walls and a top, as well as some enforcement below the top board to make it sturdy. One side is open, so I can crawl under it to make holes, connect electrical wires, etc.

In the beginning of the project I wanted to have the possibility to move the whole thing in pieces, so I cut another thinner board in 6 pieces, put these pieces on top of the baseboard as a 3x2 grid, and added small brackets to the sides of the baseboard for keeping the thinner board pieces in place (you can see the brackets in the image).

## Elevation

Next, I designed how the track pieces would be laid out and draw some sketches to the thin boards. It was important to check that I could put the track pieces together the way I wanted.

Then, I started to add elevation by cutting pieces of hard styrofoam. I used a tool that looks like a soldering iron, but has a different blade and doesn't get too hot. The smell was awful, even with windows and doors open I could work only a short period at a time.

For attaching the layers of styrofoam, I used toothpicks and glue. Very simple, but worked well.

![image-center](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3ejJ5xy94gOlw5JLY5ndQwdjrzU0xoBT059LV_n2MoeaEnblNhily4fRoiKW-L3UpGfdiQbXuzVz_0vlJ_pM1I7sVZ_Y9zjUGayB8osJwE6cYKOHvfCbVj-V8sIv0uuuteC1rK2ggfktSGorYh2W_Mf=w1194-h895-no?authuser=0)

Some layers I didn't glue together at this phase. It was necessary to be able to open the tunnels later for making their interior walls, etc. However, the lowest layers I did glue to the thin boards. As a result, I had 6 parts that could be placed on the baseboard but also removed whenever necessary.

After cutting the styrofoam parts, I built the railroad and tested it to make sure that the parts fit the planned route, and also that the elevation is not too steep for the locomotive - it has to be able to pull at least two cars uphill. (By the way, the tool I used for cutting the styrofoam is on the right).

## Pulp

The surface of the cut styrofoam pieces looked rough. I wanted to make it smoother and be able to refine the forms of the landscape. For this purpose, I tore some newspapers into pieces and added water and wallpaper glue. Then I mixed it using a power drill and got a kind of paper pulp. It was really wet, so I filtered it.

Then, I started to apply the pulp as a thin layer on top of the styrofoam pieces.

It took quite some time until the pulp dried. I used a fan to speed it up.

![image-center](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fNcIRPbtX5bDvTAMKUmUsRRAqWOtoy9QTBT2Vv5EA5QyAzCztYrvAcg-MYqd6PEJLwxtKke3QrGgD7GMkT2wXkX4_8beovjvdbzZASY0_LSkHCCutwTXC1hTQZIXDZIfr4Jg_jCS76ixBS98TFFl4b=w1194-h895-no?authuser=0)

Once it began to dry, the color of the surface started to turn from light gray to white.

Again, I built the track and tested that everything still worked as expected.
