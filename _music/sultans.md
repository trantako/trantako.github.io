In the early 2000s, I played a keyboard in a band. We practiced on every Tuesday night for three hours. During short breaks, our guitarists liked to jam and generally fool around by playing guitar solos from the Dire Straits' and Mark Knopfler's hits. They taught me the chords and I really liked the finger-picking playing style, the melodies, and overall feeling of Mr. Knopfler's music. I have been listening him a lot since then.

## The Original Version

The solo's of the famous hit *Sultans of Swing* were my absolute favourite. As many learning guitarists, I have struggled a lot in learning to play them! 

Check out how Mark himself plays and sings the song. It looks so easy and almost a bit aggressive how he handles the instrument. Love those vibratos!

## Learning to Play...

During the years, Youtube became very useful as a platform for teaching (and learning) guitar tricks. For me, Justin Sandercoe's *Justin Guitar* channel's lessons were extremely helpful and kind of unlocked the secrets of this song (thanks Justin!) 

I learned all the licks from his Sultans of Swing videos 1-4. That last, speedy lick in video 4 is still quite difficult for me!

## Some Amazing Covers

There are lots of covers of this song on Youtube. One of my favorites is Josh Turner's version, where he beautifully accompanies himself and also plays the solos:

Here's another, very skillful cover by the *Overdriver Duo*, played with two ukuleles. And yes, her thighs do look nice, pretty sure it's filmed like this on purpose... Just focus on the music, will ya!

<br/>

Let's take one more. Here's a metal cover by Leo Moracchioli, featuring the wonderful Mary Spender. I think Leo sometimes goes a bit too far with that metal guy attitude, but hey, this video is quite humorous anyway and 24 million people cared to watch it, so who am I to judge.

There's pleanty more on Youtube. Sultans of Swing seems to be a song that is loved by many generations of music lovers and guitarists, and it also inspires people in creating covers with all kinds of playing styles.

## The COVID-19 Quarantine

In April 2020, basically the whole World was staying at home and finding ways to pass time. Re-creating works of art at home became a thing. People were very creative, using whatever things they had at hand, and posed in front of a camera in a way that resembled a famous portrait.

All of this reminded me of my old wish to one day record Sultans of Swing as a 360-degree video where I'd play all the instruments. I thought, music is a form of art, too, so why not re-create this old hit  with whatever instruments and skills I had NOW. I'm never going to be "good enough" guitarist anyway.

So, I recorded cajon (bass/snare drums), bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and the guitar solos with Ableton Live, track by track. Once satisfied, I put a 360-degree camera at the center of the room, put the music on, and recorded myself playing one instrument. Then I moved to a different position in the room, and recorded me playing another instrument. I repeated this approach, until I had all five instruments captured on camera.

Next, I used Adobe Premiere to fuse the 360 videos together in such a way that all five copies of me appeared at the same time. I added the audio track and now had a 360-degree video cover of the Sultans of Swing. However, vocals were missing! The song is pretty boring without a vocal track. Since I am not much of a singer myself, I used Mr. Knopfler's original vocal track, which - to my surprise - was available on Youtube!

## My 360 Version

I made a couple of versions of the video. Here's a 360-degree video with a short background story before the music:

> This is a 360-degree video - you can use touch, mouse or WASD keys for panning the view by dragging. 

Since many viewers will miss possibility to pan especially on Facebook shares, I added a few camera angle changes. However, that turned out problematic, as some clones stand and some sit, so I had to adjust the pitch angle to keep everyone's face in the vertical image area. Which, of course, messed the floor leveling! Making forced perspectives in a 360-degree video is always controversial.

On the other hand, fusing the clones together into the same image worked really well. Also, lighting and shadows did not cause problems at all. I assumed that would have been a major headache.

The space was tight to get five players in the same room, but in the end that worked, too. It was paramount to have enough space around each player, else fusing them together would have needed a lot of masking work in the edit.

## My 2D Version

Since some devices (iPhones and iPads, mainly) still cannot play 360-degree video in a browser, I made another version as a re-framed 360-degree video. Another reason was that I wanted to have a version without the background story - just the music.

This is a kind of director's cut, where camera angles are hand-picked by me from the 360-degree video. The output is a regular 2D video. Using the 360-degree camera as a source allowed using some extraordinary camera angles! Here's the second version.

> For both of my videos, the copyright has, of course, been claimed via Youtube by the copyright owner of the song. I am not making any money out of this. It is just for fun and one more tribute to this evergreen song by Mr. Knopfler.
