## Porsche 911 GT3 RS

Every man needs a Porsche, right? Unfortunately, this was the only thing I could afford. And still, it cost me dearly. More than 300 euros, I think. The most expensive Lego set I have ever bought.

The crazy thing is, I didn't even build it myself. A few years back at work we were rushing to release a new product. I bought this Porsche and brought it to the office, to be built together as a prize for completing the product release.

There was a lot of tire-kicking, box-shaking, and other "can we please do it already" maneuvers during the next couple of weeks. I tried to stay firm, but eventually some of the guys just couldn't resist anymore - the product is good enough now! Well, a software application is *never* truly ready, so we gave in.

In the end, everyone who wanted to participate could build it a little further as we held it on the company's coffee room table. Good times and money well spent.

By the way, the instruction book for this set was in a whole new level for Lego. And so was the box.

We kept the Porsche at the office for some time, then I took it to home. I still feel it looks awesome and is a feast for the eye on my shelf.
